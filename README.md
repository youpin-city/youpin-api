# YouPin API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/youpin-city/youpin-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/youpin-city/youpin-api)

API (dev environment): https://dev.api.youpin.city
All data is sent and recieved as JSON.

## API Documents
API Documents is auto-generated by [apidoc](http://apidocjs.com/) and can be accessed at https://youpin-city.github.io/youpin-api-docs.
Moreover, we also have [POSTMAN examples](https://github.com/youpin-city/youpin-api/tree/master/usages) that you can try by importing it to your own POSTMAN.

## Run
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is needed to run your local YouPin API. After you have Docker, please follow the following instructions:

1. Clone repo
`git clone git@github.com:youpin-city/youpin-api.git`.

2. Get credential GCS private key. Currently, YouPin API depends on Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to store photos and videos.

    1. Follow [instruction 1 to 9](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#generating-a-private-key)  to get GCS private key.
    2. Rename the key to `youpin_gcs_credentials_xxx.json` where xxx is `development` for DEV environment or `production` for PROD environment.
    3. Place it under `config/gcs/` (Ex. `config/gcs/youpin_gcs_credentials_development.json`)

3. Setup your YouPin config. Always having `config/default.json` as a basic settings for DEV environment. If you want to run using PROD config, add additional `config/production.json` for PROD to replace some fields in default.json. Please find some useful templates under `config/` folder itself.

4. Start service with `docker-compose up -d`.
The service will run on port 9100. To stop, run `docker-compose stop`. If you need to build a new docker image with modified code, run `docker-compose up --build -d`. To run on PROD, just add `.env` with the content `NODE_ENV=production` to YouPin root directory.
